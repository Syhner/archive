# Tools for linting, testing, and building in the Python ecosystem

## Linting:

- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is capable of detecting both logical and stylistic lint by adding the logical lint detection of PyFlakes to the style and complexity checks of of pycodestyle (formerly pep8).
- [Pylama](https://github.com/klen/pylama) is a code auditing tool composed of many linters and tools for analyzing code.

## Testing:

- [Robot Framework](https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/) is an open source project with it's core implemented in Python, and is used for acceptance testing, acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) and robotic process automation (RPA).
- [PyTest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) is one of the most widely used Python testing frameworks and supports unit testing, functional testing and API testing.

## Building:

- [PyBuilder](https://pybuilder.io/) is a software build automation tool written in Python and is based on the concept of dependency-based programming.
- [Ninja](https://pypi.org/project/ninja/) is a small build system with a focus on speed, is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

# CI alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions

- [Drone](https://www.drone.io/) - a self-service CI platform
- [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) - part of the GitLab platform
- [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) - a fully managed CI/CD service
- [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) - an open source CI tool

### Self-hosted or cloud-based?

A self-hosted CI solution would be ideal for a large project with multiple teams and/or multiple projects, or if there are any special requirements that are hard to fulfill with cloud-based solutions. This allows for full control of the environment and resources in which the CI would operate.

A cloud-based solution would be ideal for small to medium sized projects since it can be more accessible than self-hosted solutions, and configuration is much easier.
